# Instructions on Installing and geting the Program running in Windows:
1. Install MinGW compiler and SFML from the following link: 
   https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/
      - Make sure the that your MinGW and SMFL are the same version

      - Download SFML installer --> GCC 7,3,0 MinGW (SEH) - 64-bit
      - If you don't have MinGW compiler --> MinGW Builds 7.3.0 (64-bit) download it from this website, link is in the orange box
 2. Save both of them somewhere in you file explorer, it would be easy if you save it in the Window directory.
      - Create folder SFML and save the installed SFML in there
 3. Download AVC Win10.zip, extract and save that to a folder

# PLAN

| Objectives | Due date | Item due | Tasks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Start the project | 4 June | Planning of how the project is | Gather as a group to complete AVC planAs a group tests all installations. Help to install SFML on all team computers if they are having problems. Each group member should get started on keeping a log what they are doing (such as getting the program started). This allows us to start the process of tracking how the progress is coming along. |
| Core and completion | 11 June | Core and completion code | Write code so robot can follow a line so it can complete the core.Write Extend the code for the robot so that it can also do the completion maze as well. Ethan will be in charge the coding primarily, and that progress is being made to reach our deadline. Jaedan and Katatu will assist with coding and debugging it to see if robot is &quot;flawless&quot; at achieving the goal. Alongside, making sure that code is written well and easy to follow.Suvee in charge of the report and planning of meetings. Ensuring that people are doing what they are supposed to, and we are an effective team.We will all ensure we keep in communication with each other. We need at hold least weekly meeting with each other so that we can together and discuss progress. This should be done on the 11 June (or earlier if progress is good). |
| Challenge | 18 June | Challenge code | Get Challenge Code completedEthan will oversee writing a detailed procedure to ensure our program can be easily downloaded and run by anyone. Other members will need to test these instructions to ensure they are of a high quality.This second week should go a lot like the previous one did. So, we plan on everything running the same. Suvee is in charge of overseeing that the noncoding related aspects progress smoothly and Ethan is in charge of overseeing the coding related aspects.Record all the discussions regarding the Challenge code and have a meeting near the end of this week to ensure already to handed in our code. |
| Project codeGroup Log | 19 June | Core, Completion, Challenge all turned in. | Ethan will do a final run through and make sure everything is working as it supposed to be. |
